# Final project: Web Application Development


### 1. Implementation of the DB, tables and examples

This section explains how to implement the database, tables and sample data needed to test some of the project's functions. 

1. Locate the directory "final-project-web" in the root folder of the Apache server, e.g.: htdocs/
2. Open the following file "/final-project-web/server/db/config.php" with your preferred text editor. 
3. Modify $root_password according to your computer's default options, in most cases this value is usually set to "root" or "".
4. From your search engine open the following file "/final-project-web/server/db/init.php" : this will allow you to create the database, tables and examples.
5. Verify that an image like the one below is displayed on your screen and that the database "companyDB" is now in the "phpMyAdmin" repository.
